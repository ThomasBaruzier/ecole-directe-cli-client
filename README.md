# Ecole Directe CLI client

Hi all!
I have been working hard on this app since a few days and I am proud to announce that my Ecole Directe grade calculator repo have been upgraded to this current CLI client.
Is has way more features, and it is modular. This means that I will be able to easily add new exiting updates in the future!

- Offline mode, based on data from last online session
- Detect studient and teacher accounts
- Perform better grades analysis than Ecole Directe (real-time averages)

## Todo :

- Teacher acc support
- More subjects support
- Mailbox support
- Schedule support
- Homework notebook support
